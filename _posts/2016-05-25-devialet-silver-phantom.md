When looking at a Devialet Silver Phantom WiFi Speaker for the first time, you may think it is either futuristic or quirky; either way, you have to admit that it is one of a kind. More importantly, according to Harry Olson, a pioneer acoustical engineer the spherical shape is optimum for audio delivery. And this is true for the Phantom. The French startup Devialet described its Phantom as "the revolutionary wireless speaker that changes forever the world of sound." 

As a high-end mono speaker, the Phantom has an admirable sound performance. The best part is the bass. As its twin side woofers vibrate providing ultra-dense sound, no matter where the Phantom is placed, you will feel the bass through the floor. The mids are clear and loud. The highs are crisp and clean. From sub bass at 16Hz to ultra sharp sound at 25kHz, the Phantom maintains its premium performance with no background noise, no saturation and no distortion. The only complaint may be the small amount of subtlety in quieter moments during playing.

Even though most wireless speakers in the market currently use the same technology, the Silver Phantom is the one that goes further with 88--yes that is eighty-eight, exclusive tech innovations inside. It has a 3000-Watts power, which surmount many other speakers. With one Phantom, you can enjoy a great solo music with high quality; with two, you will have a stereo experience. With more than one Phantom at home, you will need to buy the Dialog, which is an intelligent audio router for wireless stereo, which allow you to pair up to 24 Phantoms.

Installing the Devialet Silver Phantom WiFi Speaker Phantom takes only minutes. After unpacking your Phantoms, you need to download Devialet's Spark app on your smartphone (iOS or Android). Then you are ready to go. You can play your own music list on Spotify, Pandora, iTunes or Tidal by clicking your phone. With some complaints about lacking some significant functions such as Airplay and Comcast audio, the Spark app needs more improvements to satisfy audiophiles. In conclusion, the Phantom is a high-energy wireless speaker for audiophiles or if you simply want to enjoy the best WiFi sound.
