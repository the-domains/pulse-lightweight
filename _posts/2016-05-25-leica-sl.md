The Leica SL Mirrorless Camera is a premium camera made for professional photography. If you have a passion for taking pictures like a pro, the Leica SL maybe the one you want. If you already own other Leica cameras and lenses, the Leica SL gives you the leverage in power to use all your Leica-compatible lenses.

Equipped with many exceptional technologies, the Leica SL provides a grand user experience. It uses the Maestro series II processor, which has 2 GB of buffer memory to capture consecutive exposures at rates of up to 11 frames per second. The SL also has a 24-Megapixel CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor) sensor to ensure the highest image quality. The SL camera is equipped with other new Leica technologies such as the electronic EyeRes viewfinder that enables you to assess all decisive parameters (exposure, depth of focus and white balance) before shooting. Do you want super fast autofocus? The SL takes less than 110 milliseconds to zoom in from infinity to its closest focusing. The SL also has a sophisticated video mode, which can record in 4K in Super 35 format.

The Leica SL has a similar layout to that of the Leica S. About two-thirds of the SL's back plate is the LCD touchscreen. Surrounding the touchscreen are four buttons used to playback images, choose display modes, set magnification levels and access menu system. Some think the buttons cause confusion in use. It is true that you need to memorize those functions at first, but once you get used to them, it is not hard to use. You can connect your Leica SL to other devices such as smartphones and PC by using the built-in Wi-Fi. The free Leica app allows you to send pictures to devices, control the shutter speed and aperture remotely.

Until now, Leica has released a new lens--the Vario-Elmarit-SL 24-90mm f/2.8-4.0 ASPH lens for the SL. Another two lenses, the APO-Vario-Elmarit-SL 90-280mm f/2.8-4.0 and the Summilux-SL 50mm f/1.4 ASPH will be available this year. You can also use up to 145 Leica lenses on the Leica SL camera. Conceived as premium and professional the Leica SL Mirrorless Camera is the one to satisfy pros as well as enthusiastic photographers.
