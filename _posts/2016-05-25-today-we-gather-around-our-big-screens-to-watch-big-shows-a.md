Today, we gather around our big screens to watch big shows and big events. The overall experience of TV has continued to diminish. We must recognize that mobile apps could be the future of television. HBO NOW, Watch, ESPN, Netflix, Hulu, iTunes apps are quickly becoming how we watch movies and shows today. Therefore, Apple built a foundation around this vision with an operating system called tvOS, providing innovative ways to connect with your screen, and a smart use of Siri to search for something to watch. Perhaps, this is where television is headed. On your mobile devices and computers, you already use apps to watch shows and movies. Apps allow you to make individual choices about what you want to watch.

With Apple TV new experiences are created that could change what you expect from your big screen, making it feel as personal as your iPhone or iPad. The new apps can turn your living room into a fitness studio or a classroom. Even multiperson experiences that redefine family game night are around the corner. With Apple TV and tvOS, a redesigned interface, and the Siri Remote, there's never been a better time to be a TV. That's why the experience of using Apple TV is designed to let you feel like you're interacting directly with your TV, not separated from it. With all these new apps on your TV, what's the best way to find something to watch? Just ask Siri.

With the Siri Remote, you tell your TV exactly what you want to watch. Ask Siri to give you a few options, like "Show me popular TV shows." Siri automatically searches across popular services like iTunes, Netflix, and others, so you don't have to dig through each app individually. You can also, ask to hear an album or song from Apple Music. You can even ask Siri to find or launch a specific app. The Siri Remote lets you focus on the entertainment by using your thumb on the touch surface to scroll, select, and navigate your TV screen effortlessly. Apple is been blamed for lack of innovation lately, but the Apple TV can quickly turn public opinion around back to the good old days of fresh ideas and new innovative designs.
